# Voice-Activated Virtual Assistant using NLP and Transformers

This project implements a lightweight, offline-capable Voice-Activated Virtual Assistant that performs basic intent detection, text simplification using pre-trained NLP models, and speech synthesis using open-source Python libraries.

---

## Project Overview

- **Intent Detection**: Rule-based keyword matching for common queries like time, date, jokes, and greetings.
- **Text Simplification**: Simplifies complex sentences using the T5-small Transformer model from Hugging Face.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Converts text responses to speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
- **Execution Environment**: Google Colab or local Jupyter Notebook.
- **Offline Operation**: Fully offline after initial model download.
